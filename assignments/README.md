# Assignments

Each "lap" around Box's loop will have a corresponding assignment released on Friday and due the following Friday.
The assignments will be Jupyter notebooks. You'll implement the model and inference algorithm, apply it to a
given dataset, plot your results, and suggest model revisions, checks, etc.
