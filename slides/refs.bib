  author        = "Neal, Radford M",
  abstract      = "Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant
                   proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the
                   slow exploration of the state space that results from the
                   diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though
                   originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied
                   to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply
                   introducing fictitious ``momentum'' variables. A key to its
                   usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume,
                   and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex
                   mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute
                   Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained
                   even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time.
                   In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects
                   of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its
                   variations, including using windows of states for deciding
                   on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using
                   fast approximations, tempering during the course of a
                   trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods
                   that prevent useless trajectories from taking much
                   computation time.",

@ARTICLE{Andrieu2008-yc,

  author   = "Andrieu, Christophe and Thoms, Johannes",
  abstract = "We review adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) as
              a mean to optimise their performance. Using simple toy examples
              we review their theoretical underpinnings, and in particular show
              why adaptive MCMC algorithms might fail when some fundamental
              properties are not satisfied. This leads to guidelines concerning
              the design of correct algorithms. We then review criteria and the
              useful framework of stochastic approximation, which allows one to
              systematically optimise generally used criteria, but also analyse
              the properties of adaptive MCMC algorithms. We then propose a
              series of novel adaptive algorithms which prove to be robust and
              reliable in practice. These algorithms are applied to artificial
              and high dimensional scenarios, but also to the classic mine
              disaster dataset inference problem.",

@ARTICLE{Betancourt2017-ml,
  title         = "A Conceptual Introduction to {H}amiltonian {M}onte {C}arlo",
  author        = "Betancourt, Michael",
  abstract      = "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical
                   success, but only recently have we begun to develop a
                   rigorous understanding of why it performs so well on
                   difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice.
                   Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the
                   mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its
                   dissemination, especially to the applied communities for
                   which it is particularly important. In this review I provide
                   a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical
                   foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition
                   behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of
                   any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a
                   statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid
                   grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it
                   succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.",
