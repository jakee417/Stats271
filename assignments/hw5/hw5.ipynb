You might find the structure in the [Poisson matrix factorization notebook](https://github.com/slinderman/stats271sp2021/blob/main/notebooks/Lap_5_Poisson_MF.ipynb) helpful. (Note that that notebook used the JAX backend available in the `tfp-nightly` package, but you could have used the regular [TensorFlow Probability](tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp) package instead. The nice thing about TFP is that its functions broadcast nicely, which is helpful when we have lots of factors in the mean field variational posterior."
