  abstract      = "Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant
                   proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the
                   slow exploration of the state space that results from the
                   diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though
                   originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied
                   to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply
                   introducing fictitious ``momentum'' variables. A key to its
                   usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume,
                   and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex
                   mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute
                   Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained
                   even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time.
                   In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects
                   of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its
                   variations, including using windows of states for deciding
                   on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using
                   fast approximations, tempering during the course of a
                   trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods
                   that prevent useless trajectories from taking much
                   computation time.",

              systematically optimise generally used criteria, but also analyse
              the properties of adaptive MCMC algorithms. We then propose a
              series of novel adaptive algorithms which prove to be robust and

                   success, but only recently have we begun to develop a
                   rigorous understanding of why it performs so well on
                   difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice.
                   Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the
                   mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its
                   dissemination, especially to the applied communities for
                   which it is particularly important. In this review I provide
                   a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical
                   foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition

               documents (?semantic structure?) in order to improve the
               detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in
               queries. The particular technique used is singular-value
               decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is
               decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which
               the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination.
               Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor
               weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors
               formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with
               supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find
               this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.

  abstract  = "We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus
               genotype data to infer population structure and assign
               individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are
               K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is
               characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus.
               Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to
               populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their
               genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not
               assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to
               most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they
               are not closely linked. Applications of our method include
               demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning

               identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the
